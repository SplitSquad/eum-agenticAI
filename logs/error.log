The translation of the query in English is:

"Query: I have a lunch appointment tomorrow."

However, a more accurate translation would be:

"Query: I have a lunch appointment scheduled for tomorrow."

Here's why:

- "내일" means "tomorrow"
- "점심" means "lunch" but also implies a meal or a time of day
- "약속" means "appointment" or "schedule"
- "생겼어" is a colloquial way of saying "is made" or "has been scheduled"

So, the translation is a bit more nuanced, but the general idea is that the speaker has a lunch appointment scheduled for the next day.
